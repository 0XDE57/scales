# scales
a simple music learning tool

an experimental project with the goal of learning music theory, and implenting what I learn into this toy

## How does it work? 
Documentation in the [wiki](https://github.com/0XDE57/scales/wiki/How-to-calculate-notes-and-frequencies%3F)

## dependencies
- Python
- tkinter
- python-rtmidi (htps://github.com/SpotlightKid/python-rtmidi)

Tested with python 3.10 and python-rtmidi 1.4.9 

Turns out there are now a couple flavours of rtmidi for python in pip with very similar package names: (rtmidi, rtmidi2, rtmidi-python, python-rtmidi).
Installing the incorrect one will cause compile errors. The correct one is **python-rtmidi**.
